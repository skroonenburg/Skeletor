{"body":"Skeletor\r\n========\r\n\r\nOpinionated MVC Starter Kit\r\n\r\nVision\r\n=======\r\nTo help developers rapidly build ASP.NET MVC applications which are considered robust and best practice. \r\nTo strike a balance between leveraging cutting edge and stable production ready quality commercial software.\r\n\r\nThis is our core vision and commitment.\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n=========\r\n1. Clean architecture\r\n2. Modern UI based on Twitter bootstrap\r\n3. Assist with modern web developement tasks like dialogs, grids etc\r\n4. Build automation out of the box\r\n5. Testing and unit testing guidelines and examples\r\n6. Lean controllers and sexy routes\r\n6. Convention based dependency injection out of the box\r\n7. Interceptors to help with cross cutting concerns\r\n\r\nThe pointy stick\r\n================== \r\nThe reason for this project is it is a pain to reinvent the wheel and code this on every project. You get it for free\r\nwith Skeletor. Skeletor is the works of Blair Davidson, Hendry Luk and Padgett Rowell who are all .NET developers.\r\n\r\nOften you want to start some side project and have an idea, then you think about all the infrasture you have to \r\nset up and cant be bothered. Thats how I feel most of the time, so I decided to bring what I think is good \r\nsoftware engineering practices and principals to you, and save you the time to build you awesome bit of software \r\nwithout worrying, having to know, or just spend the time setting it up over and over again.\r\n\r\nWe are hoping to get contributions, patches and fixes from people out there. And we will consider people to participate\r\nin the project.\r\n\r\nWe are not saying we are the worlds best developers but we think we are pretty ok, thus if you disagree or have \r\nsuggestions please get in contact with us on twitter, @loose_chainsaw, @padgettrowell, @hendryluk, and give us your feedback and thoughts.\r\n\r\nHave fun with it.\r\n\r\nBlair","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
