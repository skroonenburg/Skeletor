        <h1>Skeletor</h1>

<p>Opinionated MVC Starter Kit</p>

<h1>Vision</h1>

<p>To help the majority of developers build good shipable software. We are not interested in technologies that cool for
cool sake or serve a small number of users, like RavenDb. Not to say they are not good technologies, we want 
to build tech that everyone can use, and that no one will ever get fired for using :) This is our core vision and commitment.</p>

<p>This doesnt mean its not cool technology, its just more risk adverse. We want you to feel comfortable using
well known and accepted current best practice no something new and shinny.</p>

<h1>Features</h1>

<ol>
<li>Clean architecture</li>
<li>Modern UI based on Twitter bootstrap</li>
<li>Assist with modern web developement tasks like dialogs, grids etc</li>
<li>Build automation out of the box</li>
<li>Testing and unit testing guidlines and examples</li>
<li>Lean controllers and sexy routes</li>
<li>Dependency injection out of the box which is convention based</li>
<li>Interceptors to help with cross cutting concerns</li>
</ol><h1>The pointy stick</h1>

<p>The reason for this project is it is a pain to reinvent the wheel and code this on every project. You get it for free
with Skeletor. Skeletor is the works of Blair Davidson, Hendry Luk and Padgett Rowell who are all .NET developers.</p>

<p>Often you want to start some side project and have an idea, then you think about all the infrasture you have to 
set up and cant be bothered. Thats how I feel most of the time, so I decided to bring what I think is good 
software engineering practices and principals to you, and save you the time to build you awesome bit of software 
without worrying, having to know, or just spend the time setting it up over and over again.</p>

<p>We are hoping to get contributions, patches and fixes from people out there. And we will consider people to participate
in the project.</p>

<p>We are not saying we are the worlds best developers but we think we are pretty ok, thus if you disagree or have 
suggestions please get in contact with us on twitter, @loose_chainsaw, <a href="https://github.com/padgettrowell" class="user-mention">@padgettrowell</a>, <a href="https://github.com/hendryluk" class="user-mention">@hendryluk</a>, and give us your feedback and thoughts.</p>

<p>Have fun with it.</p>

<p>Blair</p>
