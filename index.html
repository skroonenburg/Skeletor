</ol><h1>The pointy stick</h1>

<p>The reason for this project is it is a pain to reinvent the wheel and code this on every project. You get it for free
with Skeletor. Skeletor is the works of Blair Davidson and Padgett Rowell who are both .NET developers.</p>

<p>Often you want to start some side project and have an idea, then you think about all the infrasture you have to 
set up and cant be bothered. Thats how I feel most of the time, so I decided to bring what I think is good 
software engineering practices and principals to you, and save you the time to build you awesome bit of software 
without worrying, having to know, or just spend the time setting it up over and over again.</p>

<p>We are hoping to get contributions, patches and fixes from people out there. And we will consider people to participate
in the project.</p>

<p>We are not saying we are the worlds best developers but we think we are pretty ok, thus if you disagree or have 
suggestions please get in contact with us on twitter, @loose_chainsaw, and give us your feedback and thoughts.</p>

<p>Have fun with it.</p>

<p>Blair</p>
